Lori.css
========

A small (2 kb gzipped) but powerful responsive CSS library.

Documentation, examples and download: [https://hlorand.github.io/loricss/](https://hlorand.github.io/loricss/?)

Contains:

- basic 12 column grid system, with 3 screen-size breakpoints (and offset and hider classes)
- a great looking typography (with responsive media)
- pre built menu
- a bunch of helper classes (margin, padding, align, colors, shadows)

You can quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites and mockups with Lori.css. The minified library is only 6 kb, 40x smaller than Bootstrap, but you can get the size even smaller by creating a custom build. For example when you use only the grid system (2.5 kb), you can place it inline, directly in the HTML source for rapid development.
